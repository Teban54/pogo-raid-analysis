Future shadows: Shadow Dialga, Shadow Excadrill, Shadow Genesect (GP only)

Future megas: Meta Metagross, Mega Lucario, Mega Mawile (ignored because no fast move and bad stats)

Signature moves: Solgaleo/DM Necrozma, Gholdengo (no fast move), Klinklang (no fast move), Aegislash (no fast move, GP only), Revavroom (no fast move, GP only)
* Use DIB, MM and Doom Desire

Meteor Mash clone what-if: Aggron (Shadow/Mega), Solgaleo, Necrozma Dusk Mane, Genesect, Scizor (Shadow/Mega), Dialga, Excadrill, Melmetal, Kartana (with RL and PC)

Fast move what-if: Melmetal, Gholdengo
* REQUIRES Steel Beam (Gholdengo) or Iron Defense to be a fast move
* Unlikely, since Steel Beam has debuff effects, and Iron Defense is status (raises defense)
