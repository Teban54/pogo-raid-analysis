    # - "All Pokemon": All Pokemon in Game Master. (Gen 1-6 & 8, except Honedge line and Zygarde)
    #                  You will need to specify the "Raid tier" field to specify which tier they are. (Default: T3)
    # - "All Pokemon except above": All Pokemon, except those already listed in groups above.
    # - "By raid tier": All bosses of a certain tier, including past, present and future.
    #                   You will need to specify the "Raid tier" field,
    #                   e.g. "Raid tier": "Tier 5" - All past/present/future T5s (except Meloetta)
    # - "By raid category": All bosses listed under a certain category in Pokebattler.
    #                       You will need to specify the "Raid category" field,
    #                       e.g. "Raid category": "Legacy Tier 5", or "Tier 5" - current bosses only
    #
    # After choosing the group, you can then apply filters to select certain Pokemon from them.
    # All filters that are currently supported are listed below.
    # To use them, delete the first # at the start of the line, and then change the value as you wish.
    # To drop them, add back the # at the start of the line.
    #
    # Each raid boss in the ensemble is given a weight, which describes its importance in the evaluation
    # of attackers.
    # For example, if T5 Kyogre has a weight of 5 and T5 Skarmory has a weight of 1, then an attacker's
    # performance against T5 Kyogre is 5 times more important than against T3 Skarmory.
    # Use "Weight of each Pokemon" to give all Pokemon here a constant weight (default: 1).
    # Use "Weight of whole group" if you want the entire {} block to have a certain total weight, overriding
    # individual weights. (E.g. If you want all T5s to have a total of 50 and all T3s a total of 10.)
    # (If you don't want to do that, add a # at the start of the line.)
    #
    # "Forms weight strategy" allows you to change how different forms of the same raid boss gets weights,
    # such as Arceus, Giratina and Landorus:
    # - "combine" (default option): All forms combined are considered a single Pokemon, and each form splits the weight.
    #   (e.g. Each Arceus form has weight 1/18.)
    # - "separate": Each form is considered as a separate Pokemon and weighed accordingly.
    #   (e.g. Each Arceus form has weight 1, all Arceus combined are 18 times as important as another boss.)
    # Note that shadows, megas, Alolans and Galarians are always considered separate Pokemon.
    # Currently there's no way to change that.
    #
    # You can specify specific battle settings for each group listed here (e.g. Best Friends for T5s,
    # No Friend for T3s). Use the "Battle settings" key, and write all settings as a dict ï¼ˆin a {} block)
    # just like CONFIG_BATTLE_SETTINGS.
    # If not specified, CONFIG_BATTLE_SETTINGS will be used.

CONFIG_ESTIMATOR_SCALING_SETTINGS = {
    # Estimator Scaling: Estimators of different attackers against a particular boss are typically
    # scaled before their averages across bosses are taken.
    # A "baseline" is chosen - typically the best attacker, whose estimator will be scaled to 1.0.
    # All other estimators will be scaled proportionally.
    # These settings allow you to enable or disable scaling and choose the baseline.
    #
    # Example: Against Terrakion with random moveset, Mewtwo has estimator 1.64, Kyogre 2.10, Empoleon 2.19.
    # Suppose we're analyzing water attackers. If scaling is not enabled, 2.10 and 2.19 will be used for averages.
    # If "Baseline chosen before filter" is True, the best attacker before filtering attackers by type,
    # Mewtwo (1.64), will become the baseline.
    # Mewtwo's estimator is scaled to 1.0, Kyogre 2.10/1.64=1.28, Empoleon 2.19/1.64=1.34.
    # If "Baseline chosen before filter" is False, AFTER filtering attackers by type (AttackerCriteria),
    # the best attacker, Kyogre (2.10), will become the baseline.
    # Kyogre's estimator is scaled to 1.0, and Empoleon 2.19/2.10=1.04.
    #
    # Why is scaling useful? This is primarily to standardize the absolute size of estimators against
    # various bosses, allowing them to carry equivalent weight when averages are taken.
    # With no scaling, harder bosses like Lugia and Deoxys-D, which often have estimators above 3,
    # will have disproportionally greater impact on the average estimators of attackers.
    # In other words, an attacker that does particularly well against Lugia will be overestimated.
    # This is also why the "Baseline chosen before filter" is necessary, to make sure comparisons
    # of attackers of one type (water) don't become skewed by better attackers from other types (Mewtwo).
    #
    # [Baseline boss moveset]
    #
    # "Baseline boss moveset" can be either "random", "easiest" or "hardest".
    # The best attacker against this particular moveset (aka. the smallest estimator value), either
    # before or after filtering, will be used as the baseline.
    # Here, "easiest" is defined as the moveset for which the minimum estimator is obtained.
    #
    # Example: T5 Reshiram, no shadows/megas, no attacker filtering.
    # With random moveset, Rhyperior is #1, estimator 2.26.
    # With DB/DM, Dialga is #1, estimator 2.36. This is the largest #1 estimator for any Reshiram moveset.
    # With FF/Crunch, Rayquaza is #1, estimator 2.07. This is the smallest #1 estimator for any Reshiram moveset.
    # Baseline chosen with each option: "random" - 2.26, "easiest" - 2.07, "hardest" - 2.36.
    # Note that once a baseline is chosen, it will be consistent across all boss movesets. For example,
    # if set to "easiest", then all attackers against random moveset will have estimator at least 2.26/2.07=1.09.
    #
    # In practice, two options for "Baseline boss moveset" have merit and can be used accordingly:
    # - random: This allows the best attacker to consistently have estimator 1.0 for best comparison across bosses.
    #           It also gives an easy way to check the difficulty of a boss moveset (below or above 1.0).
    # - easiest: This gives greater importance to bosses with "hard" movesets, which are often coverages
    #            against its counters. If even the best attacker takes a huge hit (like Rayquaza against
    #            dragons), its scaled estimator against random moveset will be above 1.0. Thus, this raid boss
    #            will matter more when taking averages across bosses.
    #            The averages will then favor attackers who perform more consistently against bosses and movesets,
    #            like Dialga, by giving greater weight to bosses where its gap with Rayquaza is smaller.
    #            Example: T5 Palkia. Rayquaza's random estimator is 2.27, but only 1.98 against DT/AT.
    #            With "Easiest", Rayquaza's scaled estimator will become 1.14. The fact that it's significantly
    #            above 1.0 suggests T5 Palkia is a hard boss with a troublesome worst-case moveset.
    #
    # [Baseline attacker level]
    #
    # If you have multiple attacker levels, "Baseline attacker level" allows you to choose a standard level
    # to determine a baseline, and apply the same baseline to attackers of all levels.
    # Possible options include: A specific level, "min" (minimum level across all attackers), "max",
    # "average" (average level across all attackers).
    # To turn this feature off, set it to "by level", -1 or None.
    # Default is "by level" or turned off.
    #
    # Example: Suppose against a particular boss, L40 Zekrom's estimator is 2.0 and L50 is 1.75.
    # Without a standard baseline attacker level, both will be chosen as the baseline for all L40 attackers
    # and L50 attackers respectively, thus both are scaled to 1.0.
    # With baseline attacker level at 40, L40 Zekrom will be scaled to 1.0, and L50 Zekrom will be scaled
    # to 1.75/2=0.875.
    #
    # [Baseline battle settings]
    #
    # Similar to baseline attacker level, but for a standard battle setting.
    # Specified as a dict similar to CONFIG_BATTLE_SETTINGS. Multiple options in any fields are not allowed.
    #
    # Practical usages: Specifying baseline weather conditions or dodge settings, to compare the improvement
    # of weather boost or dodging.
    # In this case, the best attacker with dodging may be scaled to below 1.0.
    #
    # This field can be overridden in each RaidEnsemble with its own baseline battle settings (as long as that
    # battle settings is being run somewhere).
    # Example: Suppose the raid ensembles are T5 raids (BF, no dodging), T5 raids (BF, dodging), T3 raids
    # (NF, no dodging), T3 raids (NF, dodging).
    # We want to use BF as the baseline battle settings for both T5s, and NF for both T3s.
    # In this case, the baseline settings for T3s can be specified in CONFIG_RAID_BOSS_ENSEMBLE.
